### Food Truck Project

## Overview

This program simulates a food truck rating app, where a user can enter information regarding food truck names, food types served, and number ratings for up to five trucks. Using a menu interface, users can return information regarding the food trucks, including an overview of all trucks entered into the system, the average rating of all trucks entered, and the highest rated truck.

## Technologies Used

-Java
-Scanner
-Conditionals
-Looping
-Pass by Values
-Arrays
-While Loops
-Switches
-Iteration
-to String()


## How to Run

Upon executing the program, the user will be welcomed by a greeting and prompted to enter the name of the food truck they wish to rate, the type of food the truck serves, and a numeric rating from one to five. The program cycles through these questions up to five times, allowing data to be entered for up to five food trucks.  While the user is cycling through entries for each of the trucks, the program assigns a truck identification number to each truck. The user has no part in the identification number of the trucks. If the user chooses to enter information for less than five food trucks, they are able to leave that portion of the program by entering "quit" when prompted for the name of the next truck.  The program then displays a menu interface, where the user can choose between four numeric options: 1) list existing food trucks, 2) list the average rating of all food trucks combined, 3) display the highest rated truck, and 4) to quit the program.  The program will execute whichever the user decides, displaying the requested information for options one, two, and three, with another menu prompt. The program terminates only after the user decides to quit, and will display a goodbye message prior to exit.  

## Lessons Learned

During the course of this project I noted the importance of using multiple methods to execute specific portions of the program. While as a new programmer it proved challenging to track exactly how each method interacted with one another, I understand how valuable such a capability will be when developing more complex projects in the future.  Since arrays and pass-by-value concepts are still new to me, implementing these technologies were also challenging and required ample time to get right. Like using multiple methods within a program, perfecting arrays and passed values will be crucial in complex programming, particularly when large data sets are part of the equation.
